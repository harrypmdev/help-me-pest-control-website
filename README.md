**What do we help with pest information links**

- The 'what do we help with' section includes six links to pest information. This information can be found in full on the services page.

- The section separates the hero image and reviews background image to maintain a professional appearance, using the website colours from the navbar and footer to make sure the theme is maintained.

**Submit email query section**

- The section to submit an email query is a form to take a name, contact email and query from the user. At least the user's email and query are required so they can be contacted back about their issue.

**Contact information**

- This information box lists the company email and phone number for any users who do not wish to use the website's own call button or email query section.
- The hero image section does not provide a call option for non-mobile sized screens, so the inclusion of the company contact number here is essential.
